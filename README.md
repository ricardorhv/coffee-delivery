## 🚀 I went beyond the challenge

I did more than was requested to me

- ✔️ I created `responsive pages`
- ✔️ I created a `light/dark mode`
- ✔️ I added a `autocomplete to the city and UF by CEP`
- ✔️ I developed a `Orders page`
- ✔️ I added a `status to each order where after 45 minutes the status is updated to done`
- ✔️ I put `messages to notify the user when add/remove item to the cart`
- ✔️ I saved the `orders into the local storage`
